# System Positioning – Smart OPEX

Smart OPEX is an internal operational support system.

Its primary purposes are:
- Structuring operational expense data
- Assisting document reading through OCR
- Highlighting potential inconsistencies

Smart OPEX does NOT:
- Perform accounting validation
- Make final approval or rejection decisions
- Replace formal verification processes conducted outside the system
