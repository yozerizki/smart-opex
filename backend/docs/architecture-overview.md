# Architecture Overview – Smart OPEX

Smart OPEX is a backend-centric system designed to support operational expense
documentation, validation, and reporting.

The system focuses on:
- Structured data input by users (PIC / Verifikator)
- Document upload and classification
- OCR-based value extraction
- Rule-based validation (exact match)
- Status flagging for manual review
- Export-ready structured output (Excel)

## System Nature
Smart OPEX functions as a **Decision Support System**, not as a decision-making system.

Automated processes (OCR and validation) are intended to assist users,
not to replace human judgment or formal verification processes.
